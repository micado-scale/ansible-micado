# ansible-role-join-edge

Run this with _ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml edge.yml --tags join_ to configure any number of edge devices as MiCADO Workers and join them to a prepared MiCADO-Edge ready cluster (this requires *ansible-role-start-edge* to be run first). Make sure all desired edge devices are listed under the *edgenodes* key in the _hosts_ file and that they are populated with the correct *ansible_host* (IP) and *ansible_user* (SSH username).
